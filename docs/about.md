**DeCartography**  is an oracle that builds a social graph based on wallet address transactions. which can be called relation oracle, weight oracle, etc.

it's a bunch of use cases, for example, it makes oracle validators more decentralized, SALSA, and so much. 
Especially, DeCartography can use adjust voting power based on social distance with QF which is a method for distributing grants for more public projects.

inspired by [Plurality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsMsL5v2-Ls&ab_channel=GitcoinMedia). 

Public good is good. but, how to get more sustainability? it's the biggest problem in any organization, also the nation is one of an organization.

why is any government investing in each public good? A bridge, road, also railway, there's a public good. and it does not make money as directly.

but we can see the more big picture, it makes more increase in population, people, and economic liquidity. we called "GDP".
yes, making public good have an incentive for all citizens.

The government is the notion. to make a better organization. Governance(verb) is the technic to get a consensus from each organization.

this word was made by Rousseau(Play 16th century), who Makes rules (laws) based on the general will, and seeks techniques for governing (gouvernementalité by Foucault) in social contract theory.

in short, we have to back to modern.

"Matching gift" is sometimes used by when employees donate to something organization, and Companies add on the same amount.

**"Quadratic Funding(QF)"** is one of the ways to distribute grants. 
A different point with Matching gift and QF is, “if something organization can get support from many people, the org can get a bigger amount than few people.”

but, QF has a fundamental risk. In abstract, when an attacker split a fund to hack a matching pool, the attacker’s project can get money. 

For example, 
- Sybil Attack: multiple accounts powered by 1 person. 
- Collusion: Even if 1p1id prevents a Sybil attack, the result is still the same: the community colludes to split the funds and donate from each id.

also, actually, collusion is really difficult to define and cognitive. [Lide](https://lido.fi/) called “staking pool” which can earn ETH if you deposit to Lide than individual staking with a deposit of 32ETH. it’s can call “Collusion Smart contract / DAO”. (@adamstallard explained to called "legitimized collusion”)

So, we started from then. we define as "the people in a similar community has a tendency to collusion”. 


and we decided to not look for collusion. just adjust the voting power for each ID. 
means likes, the project which has supported a wide community can get much more amount than the project supported by a small community.

how can we get the map of the community? the answer is the social graph. 
blockchain is enough open, we can make a social graph from each Tx. this solution is already work in progress by @LnesProtocol , @gitcoin, and @blockscience (ML based) You know. 

also, I’m worried about “if fixed Analysis indicators, it will be a hack. and actually, almost algorithm has this risk.

so, we're going to go to a different way to make a social graph.
DeCartography is the world's first solution to make a social graph without centralized Analysis indicators, fully based on human assumption.
this Analysis indicator is from human's assumption and guarantee of quality powered by the peer prediction method(a kind of review system powered by a prediction market based on common sense). it makes it come true in real-time ML(actually a primitive algorithm).
